This is one of my homeworks on data science. I needed to analyze cars given in a dataset and make a multiclass prediction model - the model should predict whether a car will be in 1 of 3 price categories. EDA is made in 'homework-task' file - here I work on Data Understanding, Feature Engineering etc. After that I made several pipelines in the file 'deployment.py' and created a final prediction model. In the very end we get 'price_classification.pkl' file where the best model out of 3 tested is stored.
